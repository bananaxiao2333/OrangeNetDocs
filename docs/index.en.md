## Why We Need Your Support

!!! warning "Rising Costs"
    As ISPs continue to adjust network policies for certain routes, we've been forced to purchase new servers to address the resulting high latency and packet loss issues. These costs are increasing yearly and can no longer be covered by members alone.

Therefore, we need support from players to maintain a more stable and enjoyable network environment.
